@*This is the model that is being passed to the Razor view. It is an IEnumerable of strings, which means it is a collection of strings that can be enumerated.*@
@model IEnumerable<string>
@*bootstrap makes it so buttons are highlighted when hovered over and blue when selected*@

    @*This is a foreach loop that iterates over the Model collection of strings. For each string, it creates an a tag that is a link to the Home page with a category parameter that matches the current string. The @(ViewBag.SelectedCategory == c ? "btn-primary" : "btn-outline-secondary") syntax is a conditional statement that checks whether the SelectedCategory property of the ViewBag object is equal to the current string. 
        If it is, the button will have the "btn-primary" class, otherwise it will have the "btn-outline-secondary" class. The @c syntax is used to render the current string as text inside the link*@
    @foreach (string c in Model)
    {
        <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index" asp-route-category="@c" asp-route-pageNum="1" class=" btn @(ViewBag.SelectedCategory == c ? "btn-primary" : "btn-outline-secondary")">@c</a>
